## Russian-Chinese parallel corpus of Russian National Corpus
  > [Russian National Corpus](http://www.ruscorpora.ru/new/) (RNC) is one of the largest and highest-quality families of corpora for the Russian language. There are a large number of so-called subcorpora in the corpus — small databases dedicated to a specific area of language research (syntax, stress, etc.). One of these subcorpora is [parallel corpus](http://www.ruscorpora.ru/new/search-para-en.html); it is itself divided into twenty Russian-foreign corpora.
  
  > You can find out about what parallel corpora are [here](https://ruzhcorp.github.io/pages/1_parallel/).

### Brief History

Our corpus was created within the RNC project in 2016. Since 2019, it is available on two pages:

Наш корпус появился внутри НКРЯ в 2016 году. С 2019 года он доступен на двух страницах:
* [Russian National Corpus](http://www.ruscorpora.ru/new/search-para-zh.html) page, with a common RNC interface, but rare text updates;
* [HSE corpus projects](https://linghub.ru/rnc_parallel_chinese/search) page, with regular text updates, and

In 2020, [we received](https://studscience.hse.ru/news/348490285.html) support from the HSE for the development of our project.
In 2020 and 2021, we received support from HSE University within three projects: [firstly, for the enhancement of the corpus infrastructure](https://studscience.hse.ru/news/348490285.html), [secondly, for the linguistic annotation of the Chinese texts](https://ling.hse.ru/ruzhcorp_annotation), [thirdly, for the development of the corpus-assisted language learning programs based on Corpus](https://studscience.hse.ru/mirror/pubs/share/454835600.pdf).

### The current state of the Corpus

The volume of the Corpus is over 3.5 million words. It consists of more than 1 000 texts; the majority of the texts is the fictional Russian and Chinese literature of XIX-XXI centuries, news and official texts.

Today, the Corpus has a Russian, English and Chinese interfaces (on HSE corpus projects).

### Our Advantages

To date, our project is the only parallel corpus being developed in Russia that has four crucial features at once:
1. it represents a pair of languages - Russian and Chinese (both Putonghua and Guoyu);
2. it is available online and has a free access;
2. it has a user-friendly search system;
3. it has grammatical annotation.

We only know about [one analogue](http://ru corpus.cn/) of our project, which is currently being developed in Beijing.
