## Parallel corpora: what is it?

> A parallel corpus is a type of a linguistic [corpus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KabH1_Bsx4U), one of the main tools used by linguists in the XXI century. Like the main part of linguistic corpora, the parallel corpus is usually provided with the so-called [metainformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) (information about each text — by whom and when it was created, what volume it is, etc.), as well as [linguistic annotation](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~martinw/dlc/chapter2.htm) (each word is assigned its initial form, grammatical information, etc.).

A [parallel corpus](https://www.sketchengine.eu/corpora-and-languages/corpus-types/) is a collection of texts and their translations to another language. An important element of a parallel corpus annotation is [alignment](https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/~sara/kurser/MT16/slides/f4-align.pdf): each sentence (or a paragraph) in language X corresponds to a sentence in language Y. Thanks to the alignment, the parallel corpus becomes a useful tool for several categories of users:

* students and teachers of a foreign language (words and expressions can now be searched not in a dictionary, but in context; this is crucial for understanding the collocations of the words in a foreign language);
* translators (since the parallel corpus is a large database of all the findings that were invented by previous translators for certain expressions and techniques);
* specialists in statistical or neural network NLP — in the last decade, almost all serious companies have abandoned the development of rule-based translators (i.e., those that are based on a pre-loaded dictionary and a set of specific rules for translation). Now we need big data in two languages, where each sentence (or a smaller segment) will be given with translated correspondences. Of course, a parallel corpus for programmers differs in design from that for the translators (annotation and meta-information are not always needed there);
* linguists and translation scholars (based on such databases, many conclusions can be drawn in the field of comparative study of grammar, semantics and vocabulary).

Here are the most well-known examples of parallel corpora:
* [Reverso Context](https://context.reverso.net/) — the most user-friendly corpus for a variety of language pairs; it is used by foreign language learners and translators;
* [OPUS](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) - a combined database of parallel corpora that are often used for machine translation;
* [Bible Translations](http://christos-c.com/bible/) — one of the most ancient parallel corpora, [aligned in the XIII-XVI centuries by verses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapters_and_verses_of_the_Bible);
* [EuroParl](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/) - the corpus of official documents of the European Parliament — an EU body with 27 official languages;
* [Here](https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/parallel-corpora) you can find many other parallel corpora.
