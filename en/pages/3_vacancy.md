A large number of scientists, programmers, teachers and students work on the Corpus. All of them can be divided into several working groups, each of them performs a specific task. Below we have listed the main working groups and described the current "vacancies" for each of them. In parentheses, you will find an indication of which professional field is most likely to be engaged in this; however, these are not strict requirements and we are discussing any of your suggestions. So be sure to write!
